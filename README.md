## What is QuickUp?
QuickUp is a simple image viewer designed to allow a user to see a file the moment it is added to select folder(s). For instance, QuickUp allows instantaneous viewing of screenshots instead of having the user to manually navigate to them.

## Why QuickUp?
- **ðŸ’¼ Portability:** Only requires you to download a single binary.
- **âœ¨ Simplicity:** Unlittered with features, QuickUp gets its job done without clutter.
- **ðŸš€ Speed:** The application opens itself and images almost immediately.

## Usage
Download the latest version of QuickUp from [the releases page on Github.](https://github.com/vihdutta/QuickUp/releases/latest) Since QuickUp is an singular executable file (.exe), your anti-virus may prevent you from running QuickUp. You may have to exclude QuickUp from your anti-virus software prior to usage.

## Future Considerations
